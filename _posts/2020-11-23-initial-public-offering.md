I use a dating app called OKCupid and an experience I had on there was that I filtered myself too much. My profile started as a clumsy mess of one-liners. Over time I refined it into a much neater collection of one-liners.
 
- Injecting boardgames directly into my veins
- My Golden Rule: 1.618 (no wait that's the golden ratio)
- Joke about the sunk cost fallacy at the end of my profile

These aren't terrible, but it's not an enlightening depiction of me as a real person (which I would rather convey to anyone who takes the time to read my OKCupid profile).

This post is about the scariness of being genuine in public places when you filter yourself too much, as a defense mechanism. And it's about being yourself anonymously online, for the first time.

These lines were me when I was trying to optimise for swipes on OKCupid. Or only communicate surface-level info about myself, rather than my best attempt to be real with people. At one point I realised that about my profile and it was a sad moment because I wondered if I did this with people in real life, in some contexts. I wanted to fix this immediately. OKCupid gives you a selection of sections you can answer on your profile. One of them is "What is your Perfect Day"

As an aside, this question is also one of [the 36 questions that lead to love](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/09/style/no-37-big-wedding-or-small.html), some of which are fantastic to use as an offer of a [DMC](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=DMC) to anyone.

I thought long about it, trying to be more honest with my profile this time. What I wanted to gesture at was a contrast between any insanely big, high-energy night out and cuddling on the sofa doing nothing the next day. Having both. Being on a team with someone through the intense and the easy, if just for a weekend. Especially with someone new you're enamoured with when you're still growing to trust them.

Sadly I can't reprint my answer; my scientific adviser warns it could cause a "fuckstorm".

I was anxious about how people might take it! This feels silly because I've heard the advice dozens of times that no-one spends any time thinking about your mistakes. I hadn't internalised it. I had a sense of unease about sharing this yearning, online, in the face of probable apathy.

But instead, anyone who messages me is hyped about my answer to that question. I got into much better conversations with people than when I was gaming the system for max right-swipes. It ended up being an instructional moment for me, experiencing the dissonance between what I anticipated and what happened.

I've felt being honest with my friends has been easy peasy ever since I came out to them as trans, years ago. And even with people at work. But I see such incredible communities online, in subcultures of Twitter or LW. And feeling anxious about being genuine online is a bad reason to avoid participating.

The other useful moment that led to my writing this post, is just deciding to go pseudo-anonymous with my twooter account. Writing some tech blog posts years ago made me exasperatingly aware of the long half-life of anything you put on the internet. Even if it ages well, it might be there for a loooong time. Even though I feel safe that the kind of thing I want to post online wouldn't pose a risk to myself, I also felt instantly so much more confident after taking my real name off of things. I've been having the same problem lurking on twitter, doing the one-liner thing there too. I hope pseudo-anonymity will be my hazmat suit for handling hotter and spicier takes.

This post is the first of my ["make many thing"](https://twitter.com/visakanv/status/1200707613526114305?s=20), to be myself more online, I hope in a way which is useful or fun for others.

> it's a Saturday. Last night we went to a pub and stayed until closing because the conversation was so good, or went to a kink club, did an LSD trip, or a house party, or something else social and high energy. Perhaps too many drugs were had. Whatever the reason, we are rekt and having a lie-in. There's that Sunday morning feeling you get when it feels like you're halfway through your weekend, but it's early this time because Friday was so big.

> We wake up, fuck, hug, talk. Eventually one of us makes a joke so dumb that the other has to leave the bed in disgust. They put on coffee, lo-fi beats to relax and come-down to. Friends stayed round too, after last night. We cook something approaching a Full English.
